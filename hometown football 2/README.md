## Description

For this mini-project, you will create a working webpage display a snippet of the season's schedule for FC901. You will code this page using our VSCode text editor but you may use codepen to check your work. [Here](https://vigilant-colden-b8c981.netlify.app/) is an example of what your project could look like. Challenge yourself to change the design as much as you would like.

Typically, when developers are given a comp, there is little room for modification. In this case, I would like for you to be creative with this project. Although I have provided several images for use below, feel free to find your own. I've listed a few comp variations, just be sure your completed webpage meets the following basic requirements:

## Requirements

- Must include at least (3) images ( Be sure to use accessibility standards - descriptive alt text, and file names)
- Must include at least (2) sections
- Must Include a table - Should indicate win/loss for previous matches
- Must include the club's logo and links to the organization's website and to purchase tickets (external links - should open in a new tab)
- Should be consistent with the clubs color scheme (Use a color picker if you are unfamiliar)
- Should be styled in a way that denotes home/away games
- Must include a Footer
